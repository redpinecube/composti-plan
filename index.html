    <p>A platform designed to facilitate decentralized composting across communities in Washington. </p>
  </section>

  <p class="description">
    We support community gardens, nonprofit climate organizations, farmers, and volunteers in collecting
     various types of organic waste from businesses across Washington for composting. Washington state mandates that organic waste cannot be sent to landfills. 
     We help businesses reduce disposal costs by promoting local community composting initiatives instead of relying on large commercial facilities.
